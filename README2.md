Each player whose bet has not yet been settled gets their turn.
1) if late surrender is allowed, they may surrender at any point provided they are not bust.
2) if they have two equal cards, they may split if allowed.
3) if they do not split, they may double down if allowed.
4) if they do not double down, they may hit as many times as they wish until they bust (go over 21)
   or stand.

If there are any players whose bet is not yet settled, the dealer's hole card is shown, the dealer hits 
or stands as prescribed by the rules, and all remaining bets are collected or paid.

Insurance
When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, each player gets the chance to bet on whether the dealer has
a blackjack or not. This is done before any other player actions.
The insurance wager equals your original bet and is used to cancel out the likely loss of this bet.
A winning insurance bet will be paid at odds of 2:1, and since you lose your original bet, you'll break
even on the hand. Strategy guides tend to advice against taking insurance.

Surrender
If you have a bad hand compared to the dealer's hand (judging from what you can see of it), you can give
up the hand and reclaim half of your bet. The casino keeps the other half uncontested. You need a really
bad hand match-up for a surrender to be profitable, such as 16 vs the dealer showing a 10.

Splitting
When you get two starting cards of the same face value, you have the option to split the cards in two.
You place another bet of the same size as the original bet and play on with two hands. (Note that it is
legal to split 10-point cards even if they do not form a pair - for example you could split a jack and a
queen.)
When you've decided to split a hand, the dealer immediately deals a second card to each hand. Now, if you
are dealt yet another pair, some casino allow you to split the hand again, while others don't.
When you're done splitting, each of your hands will be treated separately, meaning that you will take cards
to your first hand until you stand or bust, and then carry on with the next hand.
If you split aces, you are dealt a second card to each hand as usual, but you are not allowed to take any 
further cards (unless you are dealt another ace and split again). All hands resulting from splitting aces
remain as two-card hands.
If the second card dealt to a split ace is a 10-point card. You do not receive the blackjack bonus for this
hand. It does however win against an ordinary 21 made of more than two cards. If the dealer also has a 
blackjack, the result for this hand is a push as usual. In many places the same rule (no blackjack bonus)
is played if an ace is dealt as the second card to a 10-point card after splitting.

Doubling down
If you're fairly sure that your hand will beat the dealer's, you can double your original bet. You're 
sometimes allowed to double down for any amount up to the original bet amount. In most casinos you may
double down on any hand, but some casinos require an opening hand worth 9, 10, or 11.
When you've chosen to double down, you'll only get one more card from the dealer.
